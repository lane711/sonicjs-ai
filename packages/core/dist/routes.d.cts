 * Routes Module Exports

 * Note: HTTP routes are application-specific and should be implemented
 * in the consuming application rather than in the core package.
 *
 * The core package provides the building blocks (middleware, services, types)
 * but each application should define its own routes based on its specific needs.
 *
 * For reference implementations, see the main SonicJS repository.
